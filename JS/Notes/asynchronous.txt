DOM:Document Object model
Till now, you have used document and console, these are web api's, browser also contains two things one is timers, fetch

Timers:  setTimeout and setInterval
setTimeout(function(){
    console.log("hi)
},2000)
setInterval(function(){
    console.log("hi)
},2000)

async logic:
JS is synchronous and single threaded language
Js will never wait for any functions so all async functions will be pushed into task queue and event loop will monitor the call stack and when call stack is empty , event loop passes async functions one by one to call stack

API(Application Programming Interface):
Application connect through APIs, Link in the API is called endpoint
In olden times we used to connect by XHR(XmlHttpRequest), but modern browsers uses fetch
